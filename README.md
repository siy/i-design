# I Design
I is planned to be a modern general-purpose programming language with brief—but readable—syntax and a comprehensive standard library. Its purpose is to combine all the good stuff from all languages, and add some more beneficial stuff. This repository is a collaborative design approach. To collaborate, add a ".txt" file with a filename describing an aspect of I's design, containing opinions, commentary, and/or invented I code, or edit an existing file.
