The most essential types are numbers and arrays.
In I's case, I say arrays should be like Lua's, in that they have two parts:
- a linear integer-indexed part,
- and a hash-table part.
I'd call them tables instead of arrays to avoid confusion.
For classes, they could be like metatables in Lua. And for instances, they could have a "type" field containing a class (by reference of course).
Instances with a "type" field containing the String class could be specially treated by the compiler, particularly when printing them.
